    "# Encapsulation \n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a concept in OOP to hide information so that it only can be accessed within the class. Information hiding is used for data hiding, hiding internal state, bundling information to organize code and hiding implementation from the user of the class as they don't need to know the details of how it works underneath. \n",
    "\n",
    "- all attributes in Python are public\n",
    "- by convention you can make an attriubte private by using_ in front of it\n",
    "- people knowledgeable in Python knows not to change it outside of the class, however thcnically you can change a private attribute outside the class\n",
    "- another way to make private attributes is through double underscore __-> which name mangles the attribute \n",
    "- import is to choose a convention and stick to it, don't mix both one underscore and two underscores in your code, that would confuse other people and ypurself "
